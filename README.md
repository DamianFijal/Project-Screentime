# Project-Screentime

Smartphones. 
	
	Our way to be connected with outside world. 

First iPhone was released in 2007 and Android smartphone followed a year later. 
Throughout the years smartphones evolved immensely and the purpose of the phones changed significantly. 
Something which was used before to communicate with friends and family, mostly through calls and texts, in this day and age is considered as main part of your business. 
There isn’t a single thing which you cannot do on your smartphone. 

Intention of mobile phones was to be in contact with anyone who you want to be in contact with.

Smartphones were invented to take this further.

So, why and for how long are you using your smartphones on weekly basis?

I have investigated personal screentime and have found some insightful information. 

I used app called “StayFree” to collect and export data.

# Project-Screentime


----------------------------------------

Smartphones. 
	
Our way to be connected with the outside world. 

First iPhone was released in 2007 and Android smartphone followed a year later. 
Throughout the years smartphones evolved immensely and the purpose of the phones changed significantly. 
Something which was used before to communicate with friends and family, mostly through calls and texts, in this day and age is considered as main part of your business. 
There isn’t a single thing which you cannot do on your smartphone. 

Intention of mobile phones was to be in contact with anyone who you want to be in contact with.

Smartphones were invented to take this further.

So, why and for how long are we using our smartphones on weekly basis?

I have investigated personal screentime and have found some insightful information. 

I used app called “StayFree” to collect and export data.

----------------------------------------

My data is from Week 36 to Week 41 of calendar year 2021. 
What surprised me was that some of the app which I thought are not used that much, finished in top 10 when I started recording data for this project. 
In particular, I was amazed by the YouTube and LinkedIn ranks.

I then calculated the time spent in hours on each app in every week the data was collected. 

Clearly, I was spending too much time on F1 game ... 
Second place is for Instagram - and it is my number one social platform (Sorry Facebook, nothing cool going on your platform ... too many useless adds in my opinion).

There is clear drop off in usage time in Week 41 for F1 game. In that week I decided that I will delete the app and focus on something else. 
Yes, I already had the data for this project and could make a decision before ending the experiment.
